By analyzing supermarket dataset through 3 months.  
I found relations between data feaures I used this correlation to predict the profit income of the supermarket at any time. 
and make decisions based on insights extracted from the dataset to improve the supermarket situation in the market.
Here is some insights

Can we predict the Gross Income knowing the Unit price of product? 

I identified our dataset into training and testing, And then applied machine learning techniques on this data.

now based on the pattern of products sales we can pridect the gross income
